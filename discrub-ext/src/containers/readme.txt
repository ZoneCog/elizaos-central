Container components that exist here should consist of a main 'container' component and any amount of inner 'child' components.
The container component should be within a folder of the same name, and any child components should go into subdirectory called 'components'.
Child components can use redux state, but ideally the container components should be passing as many props as possible, in order to keep redux state usage at a top level.
