Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai plan` to trigger planning for file edits and PR creation.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

The primary risk is that the updated regex could inadvertently fail to normalize certain valid JSON strings, or incorrectly normalize previously correct strings. The automated tests and new test cases should mitigate this risk.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in the `normalizeJsonString` function that caused extra quotation marks to be added to nested JSON objects during normalization. Specifically, the existing regex pattern was incorrectly attempting to wrap the entire nested object in double quotes, resulting in invalid JSON.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nBug fix\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there are no linked issues explaining why. If there is a related issue, it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nI encountered this bug when trying to parse nested objects from an LLM response. The parsing was failing and using the extractAttributes function. This should fix the issue.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nThe reviewer should start by examining the changes to the `normalizeJsonString` function, focusing on the updated regular expression. Review the updated test suite to ensure that the existing tests still pass and that the new tests correctly cover the bug fix.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n- Examine the code diff, specifically the regular expression modification in the `normalizeJsonString` function.  Verify that the new regex avoids matching nested JSON objects when wrapping unquoted values in double quotes.\r\n- Run the existing test suite to ensure no regressions were introduced.\r\n- Add a new test case that specifically includes a JSON string containing nested objects.  The test case should assert that the `normalizeJsonString` function correctly normalizes the string *without* adding extra quotation marks around the nested object. An example could be:\r\n    ```javascript\r\n    //example\r\n     const testString = '{\"action\": \"callFunction\", \"actionParameters\": {\"a\": \"B\"}}';\r\n     const expectedNormalizedString = '{\"action\": \"callFunction\", \"actionParameters\": {\"a\": \"B\"}}';\r\n     const normalizedString = normalizeJsonString(testString);\r\n     expect(normalizedString).toBe(expectedNormalizedString);\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n- Verify that the new test case passes.",

This PR modifies agent deletion logic which affects database operations. There's a risk of:\r\n- Database integrity issues if deletion sequence isn't handled correctly\r\n- UI hanging if database operations time out\r\n- Potential orphaned data if deletion is interrupted\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nFixes the non-functional delete character button in the agent settings UI by:\r\n1. Addressing a database foreign key constraint issue that was causing timeouts\r\n2. Improving error handling and feedback in the UI\r\n3. Adding timeouts to prevent the UI from hanging indefinitely\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nStart by reviewing the `deleteAgent` method in `packages/plugin-sql/src/base.ts`, which contains the core fix for the database constraint issue, then review the client-side changes in `packages/client/src/components/agent-settings.tsx`.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Create a new agent character\r\n2. Navigate to the character settings page\r\n3. Click the \"Delete Character\" button\r\n4. Confirm the deletion in the dialog\r\n5. Verify the UI shows the deletion in progress\r\n6. Verify you are redirected to the home page\r\n7. Verify the character is no longer listed\r\n\r\nAdditionally, try deleting an agent with:\r\n- Active logs/history\r\n- Multiple rooms\r\n- While it's running\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai plan` to trigger planning for file edits and PR creation.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"
